# enunu-multimodel-jpn
Japanese multimodel (mixed model) used for ENUNU model pretraining

This is a multimodel released ONLY to be used for pretraining. You may NOT use the model in any other use cases.
You may use the pretrained model for your model, as long as you include the text in the CREDITS.txt file in your trained model.
The data used for training this will NOT be shared to the public.

This multimodel uses partially the databases of Namine Ritsu AI (波音リツAI), Amaboshi Cipher AI (雨星サイファAI), PIX AI, Amano Naoki AI (天野なおきAI), and Deshimaru Gakuto AI (学人デシマルAI)

Special thanks to カノン (@canon_73), ちかの (@chikano1582), UtaUtaUtau (@C5G4D4A3), PixPrucer(@PixPrucer) and xuu (@uchuuzentai) for lending their database to be used.
